# Agent Dashboard Project - Active Context

## Quick Context

We are building an **Agent Management Dashboard** for the Claude Code Templates project (163 agents, 25 categories).

**Status**: Analysis complete â†’ Ready for implementation
**Timeline**: 6-7 weeks to MVP
**Docs**: See root-level markdown files (AGENT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md, DASHBOARD_PROPOSAL.md, etc.)

---

## Current Phase

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Analysis & Design
- Code review (excellent quality)
- Use cases documented (all 25 categories)
- Dashboard architecture designed
- Technical specs written

ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT**: Implementation Phase 1
- Set up React + Express.js project
- Build basic agent browser UI
- Implement search & filtering
- Create install/uninstall API

---

## Key Files to Reference

**Core Documentation** (in repository root):
- `SESSION_WORKLOG.md` - Complete work log from analysis session
- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - High-level overview and recommendations
- `AGENT_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` - Code review and use case analysis
- `DASHBOARD_PROPOSAL.md` - Complete architecture and implementation plan
- `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference and commands
- `HOW_TO_RESUME_SESSION.md` - Session continuation guide

**Implementation Files** (to be created):
- `cli-tool/src/agent-dashboard.js` - Main server
- `agent-dashboard-web/` - React frontend
- `.claude/agents-config.json` - Agent state configuration

---

## Technology Decisions

```javascript
{
  frontend: "React 18 + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI",
  backend: "Express.js + SQLite + WebSocket",
  search: "Fuse.js (fuzzy search)",
  state: "Zustand",
  analytics: "SQLite + Recharts",
  realtime: "WebSocket (ws library)"
}
```

---

## Dashboard Features

1. **Visual Agent Browser** - Browse 163 agents by category with search/filter
2. **Agent Profiles** - Install complete stacks (Web Dev, Security, ML, etc.)
3. **Enable/Disable** - Toggle agents without reinstalling
4. **Usage Analytics** - Track effectiveness, get recommendations
5. **Bulk Operations** - Install/enable/disable multiple agents at once

---

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Basic browsing and installation
**Phase 2** (Week 3): Enable/disable functionality
**Phase 3** (Week 4): Profiles and bulk operations
**Phase 4** (Weeks 5-6): Analytics and recommendations
**Phase 5** (Week 7): Polish and production launch

   - api-security-audit, code-reviewer

3. **ML/Data Science**
   - data-scientist, ml-engineer, mlops-engineer
   - data-engineer, database-optimizer, performance-engineer

4. **Content Creation**
   - video-editor, audio-mixer, social-media-clip-creator
   - podcast-transcriber, content-marketer

5. **Research Team**

## Common Commands for This Project

```bash
# Review documentation
cat SESSION_WORKLOG.md
cat DASHBOARD_PROPOSAL.md

# Install example agents
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent development-team/frontend-developer

# Check installed agents
ls .claude/agents/

# Development setup (when ready)
cd cli-tool && npm install better-sqlite3 fuse.js zod
mkdir agent-dashboard-web
```

## Questions to Address

- [ ] Approve final technology stack
- [ ] Confirm 6-7 week timeline
- [ ] Resource allocation (how many developers?)
- [ ] Beta testing approach
- [ ] MVP launch criteria

---

## Expected Impact

- **90% faster** agent discovery (5min â†’ 30sec)
- **4x more** agents per user (2-3 â†’ 8-12)
- **80% faster** project setup (5min â†’ 1min)
- **Instant** context switching (toggle vs reinstall)

---

## How This Context File Works

When starting a new Claude Code session, mention this file:
- "Read .claude/context/agent-dashboard-project.md"
- Claude will understand the full project context
- Can immediately continue where we left off
