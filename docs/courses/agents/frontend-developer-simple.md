# Frontend Developer Agent

Your AI partner for modern React development with TypeScript, responsive design, and accessibility.

## What is this agent?

The **Frontend Developer Agent** specializes in building production-ready React applications with:

- React components with **TypeScript**
- **Responsive design** (mobile-first approach)
- **Accessibility** standards (WCAG 2.1)
- **Performance optimization** techniques
- Modern CSS frameworks (**Tailwind CSS**)

This agent helps you write clean, maintainable frontend code following industry best practices.

## Installation

Install the agent in your project with a single command:

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent frontend-developer --yes
```

This installs the agent configuration to `.claude/agents/frontend-developer.md` in your project directory.

## How to use it

### 1. Start Claude Code

Open your terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
claude-code
```

### 2. Agent is ready

The Frontend Developer Agent is now available automatically. Claude Code will use its expertise when you ask for frontend help.

### 3. Example prompts

**Specific prompts work best:**

Create a Button component with:
- Variants: primary, secondary, outline
- Sizes: sm, md, lg
- Loading state with spinner
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Full accessibility (ARIA labels)

**Simple prompts also work:**

Create a responsive Card component

Add dark mode toggle to my app

## Quiz Time

?> Where is the agent installed after running the install command?
- [ ] `node_modules/` folder
- [x] `.claude/agents/` folder
- [ ] `~/.config/claude/` folder
- [ ] `/usr/local/bin/` folder

?> What makes a good prompt for the agent?
- [ ] "make a button"
- [ ] "help me"
- [x] "Create a Button with variants, sizes, TypeScript support"
- [ ] "do the thing"

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

- **Be specific** about your requirements
- **Mention your tech stack** (TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.)
- **Ask for accessibility** features explicitly
- **Request responsive design** when needed
- **Provide context** about your project

### ‚ùå Avoid This

- Vague requests like "make it nice"
- No context: "create component"
- Missing important requirements
- Assuming the agent knows your setup

## Example: Card Component

Here's what happens when you ask for a Card component:

**Your prompt:**

Create a Card component with header, body, footer sections, image support with lazy loading, hover effects, responsive padding, using TypeScript and Tailwind

**What you get:**

```typescript
interface CardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

export function Card({ children, className }: CardProps) {
  return (
    <div className={cn("card", className)}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

Card.Header = function CardHeader({ children }: CardProps) {
  return <div className="card-header">{children}</div>;
};

Card.Body = function CardBody({ children }: CardProps) {
  return <div className="card-body">{children}</div>;
};

Card.Footer = function CardFooter({ children }: CardProps) {
  return <div className="card-footer">{children}</div>;
};
```

The agent creates **compound components** with proper TypeScript typing and composition patterns.
